Deluge NetWatcher2
=================

_NetWatcher2_ is a plugin for the [Deluge bittorrent client](http://deluge-torrent.org/) that reduces the download speed of torrents to a set value if there is someone connected to the same network.

Features:

- Set a custom ip list.
- Set the check rate.
- Set the download rate.
- Option to enable logging to a file.
THIS IS A TEST BRANCH TO ADD A SPEED LIMIT OPTION


Usage
-----

### Ip Addresses

Insert a list of comma separated ip addresses in the __Ip Addresses__ field, like `192.168.1.45, 192.168.1.128, 192.168.1.149`, and these addresses will be cheked every X minutes.

Working rationale as follow:

- At least one ip address is on-line => pause all
- All the ip-addresses are off-line => resume all

**Note:** The ip-addresses status is checked through ping requests.

### Custom logging

It's also possibile to log the NetWatcher2 activity into a file.

Other than knowing what happened when we weren't at the computer, the use of this feature combined with a Dropbox-like service makes it very easy to monitor torrents status without having to access the web-interface.  
To support this combined usage the log extension is `.txt`.
